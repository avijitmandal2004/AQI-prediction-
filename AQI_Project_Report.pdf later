Name: Avijit Mandal
Course: B.Tech CSE
Tool Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Prophet

(1)Objective-
The objective of this project is to analyze historical air quality data of major Indian cities and forecast future AQI levels using time-series models

(2)Dataset Description-
The dataset was collected from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and public repositories. It contains AQI and pollutant data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃) from 2015 to 2024.

(3)Data Preprocessing-
The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and the datetime column was converted into time-series format for analysis.

(4)Exploratory Data Analysis-
Include:
.AQI Trend Graph
.Pollutant Distribution Graph
.Monthly AQI Pattern
Observation:
PM2.5 and PM10 were identified as major contributors to air pollution.

(5)Forecasting Methodology-
Facebook Prophet was used for time-series forecasting due to its ability to handle seasonality and long-term trends effectively.

(6)Results & Forecast-

Interpretation:
The forecast indicates a rising AQI trend with severe pollution during winter months.

(7)Conclusion-
The study highlights the worsening air quality in Delhi and emphasizes the need for immediate pollution control measures
